### IntelliJ HTTP Client - gRPC tests
# Requirements:
# 1) App running: ./gradlew bootRun
# 2) gRPC reflection enabled (already true in application.yaml)
# 3) Works in IntelliJ/IDEA HTTP client (uses HTTP/2 under the hood)

### gRPC - Get member by ID (existing)
GRPC grpc://localhost:9090/member.MemberService/GetMember
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": 1
}

### gRPC - Get member by ID (non-existing)
GRPC grpc://localhost:9090/member.MemberService/GetMember
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": 999
}

### gRPC - List all members
GRPC grpc://localhost:9090/member.MemberService/ListMembers
Content-Type: application/json

{}

### gRPC - Create member (currently UNIMPLEMENTED; expect error)
GRPC grpc://localhost:9090/member.MemberService/CreateMember
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "New User"
}

### Notes
# - The GRPC verb is supported by JetBrains HTTP Client (IntelliJ IDEA).
# - Uses server reflection, so no proto path is needed for these calls.
# - All calls are plaintext (no TLS) to match local dev settings.
